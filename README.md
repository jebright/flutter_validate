# flutter_validate

A Flutter package for performing validation using a fluent interface approach.

## Getting Started

Take a look at the example Flutter project accompanying this package as well as the unit tests.
But a full-fledged getting started section is coming soon!

## TODO

* Expand number and variety of validators. Including:
  * Credit Card: A validator that checks if an input string is a well-formed credit card number.
  * Comparison validators such as greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, etc.
* Support Localization/Internationalization
